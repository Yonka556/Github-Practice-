    <!-- the header elements with the style attribute below are being given their styling via in-line styling -->
    <!-- css styling is applied via key:value pairs. The key is the kind of styling you want, the value is the actual styling option you choose which is associated 
    with the key. You can set multiple styling options in-line by seperating them with a ;
     -->

    <h1>This is a h1 header with no styling</h1>
    <h1 style="text-align: center;">This is a h1 header with some css style</h1>
    <h1 style="text-align:right;color:green">this is another h1 header but this time right aligned and colored green</h1>

    <!-- 
        another way of applying styling to your web page is by using internal css. To do this, you create a style tag inside of 
        the head section and you assign your styling information there
     -->

     <p>this is my paragraph element, it has no in-line styling</p>
     <p>this is my second paragraph element, still no in-line styling</p>
     <!-- notice that the p element below has in-line styling that overrides the internal styling set about -->
     <p style="text-align: left; color:purple;border:dotted 5px">this my third paragraph element with in-line styling</p>

     <!-- you dont have to use just the element as your css selector: you can aslo assign an id and/or a class attibute to your elements and assign
        your css by them -->

        <h2 id="headerOne">this h2 has the id of headerone</h2>
        <h2 id="headerTwo">this h2 has the id of headertwo</h2>

        <h3 class="classOne"> this h3 has the class  of classone</h3>
        <h3 class="classTwo"> this h3 has the class of classtwo</h3>

        <!-- another useful way to apply styling to your element is to place them inside of a container element
            and applying styling to the container, which wll casacade down to the nested elements
         -->

         <div id="container">
             <h4>this has no styling targeting it directly</h4>
             <h4>this also has no styling target directly</h4>
         </div>
